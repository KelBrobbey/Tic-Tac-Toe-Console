# Tic-Tac-Toe-Console

Recreating the game, Tic Tac Toe, with the console using Scannner and implementing MinMax algorithm to incorporate a difficult bot mode. Hoping to use this as a template for my GUI Tic Tac Toe project. Both PvP and player vs bot modes are available.


**TODO:**
  - Refractor, reptitive code particularly regarding victory and rematch messages
  - Add ability to choose to be X or 0 when playing against easy and hard bot
